# Love Running

![Love Running on different devices](/assets/design/am-i-responsive.jpg)

'Love Running' is a code-along site built as practice before our first personal project.  It hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site is targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running is useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.

## Features

**Existing Features**

- The Navigation Bar
    - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    - This section allows the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the 'back' button.

**Features Left to Implement**

- A Member Review Section
    - This feature will be added to the 'Gallery' page and will be a great way to help users in their decision process.
    - It will also help in increasing the rankings and the diversity of keywords the website shows up for in Google.  
    - Reviews left by the 'Love Running' community will provide insights into the benefits of this organisation, what can be improved and offer a reason to engage and build a relationship with people who have joined the community.

## Testing

The 'Love Running' site was tested on various screen sizes for responsiveness.  It was also tested on various browsers to ensure that all features and styles function in the way they are intended. 

**Validator Testing**
